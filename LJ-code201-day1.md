# LJ Code 201: Day 1
## Today is our third day of class, and I left work early because I didn't finish my lab last night. I got to campus around 3:30 and time flew by. I didn't get frustrated and I got some assistance from some of the TA's. During class we went over a number of things. We first started by reviewing someones code from the lab we worked on the previous night. I found it helpful to review. We also went around the room and read the code line by line. It's a lot easier to understand code when you're hearing it outloud.

## I feel like a lot of today consisted of going over our "About Me" project and how to use Git/GitHub. I feel like I'm at a 4/5 for my understanding of the concepts we have learned so far for that. 

##Overall, I've realized it's going to be difficult for me to keep up with the assignments if I don't do them the weekend prior(the reading assignments). I'm hoping this will help me understand and follow along during class better.
