##Lately, I feel like we have been covering a lot of material.
##I think its really helpful that I took 101/102 since I dont have a lot of free time between class and work to study. It's going to be absolutely necessary for me to complete the readings for the upcoming week before the week starts in order for me to make the most of my class.

##Anyways, this weekend I dedicated my time to trying to improve my lab that I submitted on Saturday and getting a better understanding of loops because I struggle so much with them.

##I'm feelings pretty good about it.
##I have been outlining the book and making note of important concepts that I feel I struggle with.

##I'm eager for class to start so we can dive right into functions! :)
