## Entry 3 for Learning Journal.
I thought this past week was going to particularly difficult since it would be our first week kind of working without TA's or Rachel. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be! I think its helpful that we could talk to our fellow classmates when we have questions. We had too classes of mostly lecture so we took in a lot of informationt this week, but I think it was really good. Our lab that including having a partner was great too. I found it really helpful to talk about the logic of functions and loops with my partner out loud, rather than just trying to figure it out on my own. I also found out that if I write things down in steps it helps a lot too! Some of the key concepts that we covered this week with functions are syntax and grammar(how to declare a variable, how to assign them a value, data types, and arrays).
